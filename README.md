### Introduction:
The project brief was to create a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that encapsulated all the core modules covered during the training. The project requirements are set out below: 

1. Project Management - A fully expanded Jira board, clear documentation from a design phase. Code integrated into a Version Control System.

2. Front-End Development - Functioning front-end website with API (Application Programming Interface) integration.

3. Databases - A relational database to store persistent data from the project. Two databases were used in this project, a local H2 database which was used for testing the back-end and a MySQL database for storing the persistent data from the application.

4. Java SE & Spring Boot - Functional application created in OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) language which meets requirements of Kanban board.

5. Testing - Acceptable level of test coverage on back-end (JUnit, MockMVC and Mockito).

### Planning Resources:
Using Jira Software I created a Kanban board modelled as a Scrum and created the user stories. Here are pictures of my Jira Board below:

Once I had decided on my user stories I started to think about the design for the website. I created two wireframe mockups and stuck to this throughout my front-end creation.

I set up two git repositories before starting - one for the front-end and one for back-end. This is the latest commits on my network graph from my front-end repository:

And the latest commits on my networking graph from my back-end respoitory:

### Databases:
H2: The H2 database was created with travel_app-schema.sql and travel_app-data.sql files to automatically populate the fields for testing purposes.

MySQL: This is the layout of my database for the Travel Destination App. It shows the datatype of each column and also that the 'name' field has to be unique.

### Front-End: 
The front-end is built from HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used the Bootstrap framework for a few components.

### Back-End:
The back-end of this project was created using Java in a Spring Boot Framework. I tried to make sure that my Kanban board requirements were met with the correct mappings in my code.
